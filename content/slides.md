title: What's this ABOUT anyway?
notes: |
    - Public affairs
    - "The views expressed in this presentation are those of Rob McGuire-Dale, and do not necessarily reï¬‚ect the views of REI"

- A story of an on-going journey

- Preparing a large cooperative for open source contributions

- From one software engineer's perspective

title: What is this presentation NOT
notes: |
    - Start by setting expectations
    - --
    - Not an instruction manual
    - Not a story with a conclusion, ongoing journey
    - --
    - Short!
    - "If you didn't see it in the presentation description..."
    - Wheels of bureaucracy turn slowly
    - Open it up to share your stories, successes, challenges, advice, etc.

- An instruction manual

- A story with a conclusion

- Very long :(

#TODO: Build parent lists, strongify parent list titles
notes: |
    - @osbridge, should provide OSS background

title: The Journey Begins
subtitle: OSS-Savvy Engineers + Supportive Management

<!--
    - OSS - savvy engineers

    - Been working with the OSS community for many years
-->

- We depend on open source; It runs our infrastructure.

    <!-- Java, Jenkins, Apache, Maven, Node + hundreds of other libraries and tools -->

- We want to give back

    <!--
        - Hippy reasons: Passionate people

        - Culture of environmental stewardship and community service (extend -> software)
    -->

- Increase code quality

    <!--
        - "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow" - Linus's Law (need to find/fix bugs anyway, better to find them sooner)

        - Higher quality code if know your name is publicly attached to it
    -->

- Let community hack and remix

    <!--
        - Engineers are busy

        - What can the public come up with given these APIs?
    -->

- Dev cred

    <!--
        - More selfish reasons...

        - Reputation. "Oh, you're a WEB DEV" feel like I have to defend my honor

        - Attracting devs. (Many devs don't know REI develops its own software.)

        - We want to play!
    -->

title: Archeological Evidence
subtitle: Ghosts of the past

<!--
    - Working at REI for 15 months (yes, still in months)

    - Ever dig through code and find ghostly footprints?

    - Oh god, someone's tried this before!
-->

- code.rei.com

    <!--
        - Intended to document our APIs/SOA architecture

        - Security shut it down (security through obsurity)

        - Sitting on the edge of our network, blocked by a single firewall filter
    -->

- Engineering blog

    <!--
        - Engineers write blog posts re: solved problems
    -->

title: Into the Shadow
subtitle: Covert OSS Community

        - AirBnB fork, JS style guide

        - documentation deemed safe by management
    -->

title: Quest for Legitimacy
subtitle: Management Heads the Political Battle

<!-- As with many development problems at REI, the hardest part is political, not technical -->

        - Through the director level

        - Agree it aligns with REI's core values of stewardship and community service

        - Green light
    -->

- Meet with the OSU Open Source Lab for guidence

     <!--
         - Gracious
     -->

    - Legal Liability?

        <!-- Most OSS licences release liability -->

    - Competitive advantage?

        <!--
            - Retailer

            - Front-end code accessable for the curious anyway
        -->
