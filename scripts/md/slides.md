build_lists: true

<!-- On top of developer sanity... -->

Case study: Home Page on Mobile     <!-- Typical, non-FEBS page -->

- 88% unused CSS + 17% uncompressed JS = 480 KB unnecessary text <!-- as of May 2014 -->
- 2-7% conversion loss per second load time
- REI made $15.8 million * 4.6% conversion (FY2013, mobile) => $0.32 - $1.1 million/year/sec in lost sales
- Per US average mobile speeds, 480 KB => 0.6 - 2 sec
- Lost $0.25 - $2.25 **million** last year on mobile

<!--
- US average 3G speed 244 KB/s
    - 480 KB ~=> 2 sec ~=> 4-14% conversion loss for 3G
- US average 4G speed 756 KB/s
    480 KB ~=> 0.6 sec ~=> 1.3-4.4% conversion loss for 4G
